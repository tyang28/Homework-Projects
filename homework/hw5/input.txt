5 ch ou ee sch wh

I was lucky. All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was getting the hell out. I suddenly remembered this time in around October that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around in front of the academic building. They were nice guys, especially Tichener. It was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out but we kept chucking the ball around anyway.It kept getting darker and darker and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we did not want to stop doing what we were doing. Finally we had to. This teacher that taught biology Mr. Zambesis stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner. If I get a chance to remember that kind of stuff I can get a goodby when I need one, at least mostof the time I can. As soon as I got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill toward old Spencer house. He did not live on the campus. He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.
